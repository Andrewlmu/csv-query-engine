COMMERCIAL DUE DILIGENCE REPORT

Client: Phoenix Capital Partners

Transaction: $250M Buyout
Report Date: October 28, 2024
Prepared by: McKinsey & Company

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Lambda Retail Group is a regional specialty retailer operating 127 stores across the Southwestern US, focused on outdoor recreation and adventure sports equipment. Our commercial diligence indicates a well-positioned business in a fragmented $18B market, with defensible competitive advantages in merchandising and customer experience. However, near-term headwinds from athletic retailer competition and e-commerce pressure warrant conservative growth assumptions.

Key Findings:
→ Differentiated product mix (55% private label vs. 15% industry avg) drives margin premium
→ NPS of 72 significantly outperforms outdoor retail average of 48  
→ Store-level economics strong: $3.2M avg store revenue, 18% EBITDA margins
→ E-commerce penetration of 12% lags competitors at 25-30%
→ Geographic footprint expansion limited by saturation in core Southwest markets

Market Opportunity: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
Competitive Position: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
Management Quality: ★★★★☆ (4/5)  
Growth Prospects: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
Risk Profile: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

RECOMMENDATIONS

Investment Thesis Validation: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

STRENGTHS:
✓ Defensible competitive position with private label and customer experience
✓ Healthy store-level economics with proven unit expansion model
✓ Experienced management team with deep domain expertise
✓ Multiple levers for value creation (e-commerce, new stores, private label)
✓ Attractive market with structural tailwinds (outdoor participation, premiumization)

CONCERNS:  
✗ E-commerce capability gap vs. competitors creates vulnerability
✗ Geographic concentration limits risk diversification
✗ Management team gaps (digital, operations) need to be filled quickly
✗ Near-term comp sales pressure from traffic headwinds

VALUE CREATION PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS:

Immediate (Months 1-6):
1. Hire Chief Digital Officer to lead e-commerce acceleration
2. Implement digital marketing stack (GA4, customer data platform, attribution)
3. Launch site redesign project with mobile-first focus  
4. Expand e-commerce team from 4 to 12 FTEs
5. Build 100-day plan for same-store sales initiatives

Near-term (Months 6-18):
6. Roll out loyalty program enhancements (tiered benefits, gamification)
7. Open 5-6 new stores in Texas market (DFW, Austin, Houston)
8. Launch gear rental pilot in 10 stores  
9. Implement warehouse management system for distribution efficiency
10. Hire COO to support operational scaling

Medium-term (Months 18-36):
11. Expand private label from 55% to 65% penetration
12. Launch marketplace strategy (Amazon, REI, brand partnerships)
13. Open 10-12 additional stores (Texas, Mountain West)
14. Build experiential retail playbook (demos, clinics, community events)
15. Evaluate M&A targets for geographic expansion or capability acquisition

CONCLUSION

Lambda Retail Group represents a compelling investment opportunity in the growing outdoor retail market. The business has built a defensible competitive position through merchandising differentiation and customer experience, with multiple levers to drive growth and margin expansion.

The commercial opportunity is strong (4/5) with clear path to $750M+ revenue in 5 years through e-commerce acceleration, new store growth, and same-store sales initiatives. However, near-term execution risk around digital capabilities and management team buildout warrant close involvement in the first 12-18 months post-acquisition.

We recommend proceeding with the investment subject to:
1. CEO agreement to hire Chief Digital Officer (retained search launched pre-close)
2. Management equity rollovers sufficient to maintain alignment (minimum 25%)
3. Covenant flexibility in financing to support new store growth and e-commerce investment

Expected returns are within target range for the fund (3.0-4.0x MOIC, 25-35% IRR) across conservative to base case scenarios.
